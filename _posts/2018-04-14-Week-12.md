### 1. What did you do this past week  

Got really stressed over Matrices, but it was fine.   
Pivoted our startup again.   
Did some contracting work with IE11 CSS stuff. That sucked. I got it to work though.  
Also ran a 25:40 5k. Pretty proud of that.

### 2. What's in your way?

I need to book tickets to SF and also get like an AirBnb ASAP, but I'm really lazy and tired rn. I also need to check classes.

### 3. What will you do next week?

I'd fly away to another place just to be in CS361S Network Security & Privacy  
The star's aligned and now they shine so brightly on my registration  
Even the greatest works of couldn't describe Cam Beasley.

Every single time I hear Network Security & Privacy  
I'm in a void  
Time has stopped and life is still  
I can't even try to comprehend  
That feeling when..  
I get into that class GET ME IN.

Point is I want to take NetSec soooo badly. I'd do anything to take that class. Super hyped for that class. But yeah. Registration's gonna be a mess.  
Also, I have BlockDev. Gonna be pitching our startup there. XO.

### 4. What's my experience of the class?

My experience of the class has been good. I thought the refactoring talks were interesting at first, but now it's quickly becoming tedious.  
I still think the blogs are extremely restrictive.

I don't know what to say  
So maybe I should just stay home  
So I don't have to do the blog    
Standing out there in the cold  
Waiting for me to say  
The words that you wanna hear  
But I can't  

Words are the hardest part of every situation  
They can make you make or break you  
And your expectations  
I'm not always good at knowing what to say

### 5. What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

My pick of the week is [Nuclide](https://nuclide.io/). I recently upgraded my Atom with Nuclide, and it's fantastic. My setup looks 100% better, and I'm able to get a lot more work done quickly. It's slightly laggy, but I like the UI and the extra features. The good outweighs the bad.

Thanks everyone! Have a great week ;P.
