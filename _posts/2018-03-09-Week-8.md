### 1. What did you do this past week  

I took two tests last week, one in Cloud Computing, which was a breeze. It was basically an overview of AWS, so it wasn't bad at all. My other test was in Matrices, and it was OK. I messed up a reduction from a 4x4 to a 3x3 for a questions asking how to find the determinant.  
I also did two coding interviews for an internship in the fall, but I'm not completely sure if either company knows that it's for a fall internship.   Whatever. They were fun problems that I got to work through. I did both interviews in python, and it was surprisingly easy.  
I've also been working through a new diet in an effort to lose weight and get the summer bod (not really, I just want to feel good). I've also started to ramp up my runs. I recently broke an 8 minute mile after a week and a half of dealing with a knee injury! Pretty proud of that.

Second mile was less good.... It was OK.

And then I started cramping/feeling pain on my feet on Mile 3. RIP.

### 2. What's in your way?
I have a hackathon today that I'm planning on attending. It's the SXSW hackathon. I'd really like some time to relax, but this is a hackathon I cannot miss out on. This will really screw over my sleep schedule, but it's going to be fun, so meh.

### 3. What will you do next week?

I have to do write an AR app for convergent, write a website for a freelance gig I'm taking on, handle logistics for an event ISSS is putting on, and fix up some Freetail tech in anticipation of our spring hackathon. Lots to do.

### 4. What's my experience of the class?

My experience of the class has been good. I enjoy IDB2. I wrote unit tests for the backend last week, and I'm about to write all the frontend API calls right after this blog. I missed class on Friday, and I heard it was some good stuff, so I'm pretty salty over that.  
I still think the blogs are extremely restrictive. I'd like to write about some other stuff, but there's the fact that we're forced to respond to a couple of questions, which means most blogs are terribly mundane. It'd be interesting to change it up.

### 5. What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

My pick of the week is [Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum), which is a Go implementation of the Ethereum protocol, enabling you to create applications on the Ethereum netework. It's really nifty and a lot more flexible than writing everything from scratch using Solidity or some janky node client. Would recommend.


Thanks everyone! Have a great week ;P.
