##What did you like the least about the class?  

I didn't like the disconnect between the class and the projects, and also the sometimes arbitrary grading on the projects themselves. I also didn't find myself enjoying the refactoring lectures at all. I also didn't like the 10AM lecture time, as I found myself frequently struggling to get up and into class in time.  

---
##What did you like the most about the class?  

One thing I enjoyed was the iDB project. I found that pretty fun, although things got really busy for me and I wasn't able to put as much time in as I would have liked. The other thing was the Python lectures. Those were pretty cool.

##What's the most significant thing you learned?  

Because the class is divided into two parts, I'll address this question separately with regards to each part.   
1. I didn't find myself learning much with the iDB project. I already had a lot of experience with the tools used, so I didn't find it too useful. It was nice to work with and meet new people.   
2. Most significant thing I learned in class was definitely generators. That was cool.

##How many hours a week did you spend coding for this class?  

For iDB1, I spent around 60-70 hours for two weeks configuring and setting things up, since we used React for phase1, and we were ahead of everyone because of the time we spent skipping the static HTML page and going straight to React. Afterwards, I spent around 7-8 hours a week on iDB, and that ramped up to 15-20 the week of exams preparing for the exams by typing up the code in Jupyter Notebook.  

---
##How many hours a week did you spend reading for this class?   

Not much. I didn't find a lot of the reading too important or interesting, so probably 1-2 hours.  

---
##How many lines of code do you think you wrote?  

Probably 2-3k lines of code, with a lot of server config stuff.  

---
##What required tool did you not know and now find very useful?  

I learned Kube/Docker separately on my own time, and I wish that was required. It's good to know that it will be required next semester.   

---
##What's the most useful Web dev tool that your group used that was not required?  

I just use a bunch of packages. I realized this from my last internship, and people have a crap ton of pre-written code that can be used by anyone.  

---
##If you could change one thing about the course, what would it be?  

Blogs. Blogs were too restrictive imo, and it would be cool to see people ttalk about something else other than the same 5 prompts every week.  

Coolio. Have a great summer.
