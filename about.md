### Hobbies

I love creating EDM music. I use Ableton Live Pro, FL Studio 12, and Audacity to create the base soundtracks, and then I sometimes get a friend to sing vocals, and use Sony Vegas to append the vocals in.

I also love cooking. I've been raised in a family that cares deeply about food, so I care about food as well. I love making food for my friends to enjoy!
